Please use the 'Misc SPP' box to assign SPP to ONE player per team.<br>Use the 'Next Skill x/y SPP' information next to each player to determine how many SPP to assign: x for a Primary skill (on a chosen player) or y for a Secondary skill (on a random player).<br>Please note that although you can choose a player to advance (Primary skill only), all skill advancements will be random.<br>Remember also to roll for "The Draft"- after every match roll a D6 for every player that has extra skills: unless the roll is higher than the number of skills the player(s) achieved, they will leave your team for the big leagues!
